# my_malloc
A recreation of malloc which can be used to allocate and free memory in the same way as C stdlib malloc. This was a project for my TCSS 333 at the University of Washington Tacoma in the Summer of 2017. This program built upon the previous assignment to create a linked list from scratch.
